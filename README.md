# Battleships API

This is fun little API I made for [Raspapi](https://raspapi.hackclub.com) that allows you to play a game of Battleships as an API!

You can choose to play either with another player, or with a computer that is fully randomized for each attack and ship placement.

Wondering how to get started? [Here's the docs!](https://github.com/pbhak/battleships-api/wiki)
